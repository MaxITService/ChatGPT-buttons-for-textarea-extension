name: Edit Chrome UI
instruction: |
  this is jsut first attempt to ui. It looks somewhat correctly, but seems to not work
  Tasks: Bigger UI. 
  Bigger Text edit areas. Save and reset button at top.
  Add separator button.
  Messages like <Configuration saved succesfully> and <failed to save>
  Last saved: if not saved should read <never>
  Items can be re-arranged via drag and drop.
  Think, will it work? Not saves or not loads not. What can be enchanced? 
  Probably both saving and loading could log what happened. A save button should 
  force re-initialization. Re-initialization in this case should update already existing
  buttons, not stop on encountering them.

  - hello.html
  - hello-page-script.js
  - hello-page-style.css
  - config.js
  - log.js
  - init.js
