name: Make logging the better logging
instruction: >
  This is chrome extension. I wroten a new file, log.js. Rewrite this, so it
  uses a function in log.js that writes logs to console. And log.js... you have
  to write it yourself. There lies best pratce logging in console. But all logs
  are written as user logs. (not warnings). Then I will completely rewrite files to use this log, but now,
  I will only start with a single file. Log file should tell how to use it's function. Also use fucntion name like 
  logConCGP. Log file has commment stating that all files should now use this logging.

files:
  - init.js
  - log.js
